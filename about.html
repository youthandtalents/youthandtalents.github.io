        <p>Chisuma is a small village 25km east of Victoria Falls. Perched on the escarpment of the Mighty Zambezi River the
        village is inhabited by 3000 - 4000 local villagers. Such diversity of tribes within the area provides a potential of
        developing Chisuma village into a food basket for hotels, lodges and other entities within Victoria Falls.</p>
        <p>The name ‘Chisuma’ is derived from an indigenous fruit tree bearing a sweet taste common in the area, elders say it
        means a very big “chi“ tree of that species (called unsuma).</p>
